**Handling Multiple Analysis Units:**
Crucially, if the article analyzes or reports results for different subgroups, datasets, study phases, models/algorithms, or other conditions separately (especially involving variables marked 'Y' for multiple inputs like 'Type of cancer', 'Study-phase', 'model-name', 'Type of models', 'type of algorithm'), **you MUST create a separate JSON object for each distinct analysis unit or unique combination**. 

Carefully examine the article to identify *all distinct groups or conditions* for which results are reported separately. Consider all combinations of key variables like 'Type of cancer', 'model-name', 'Type of models', 'Study-phase', 'Text representation', etc., that necessitate separate reporting.

Ensure each JSON object contains key-value pairs for *all* the variables listed in the template. Repeat common information (like author, year, title, journal) within each JSON object as necessary. If a specific variable (e.g., a particular evaluation metric like AUPRC) is not reported for a specific analysis unit, use `null` or an empty string "" for its value in that specific JSON object. Do not use lists like ['null'].

**Output Format Requirement:**
* Provide the output strictly as a **JSON list**.
* **Each element** in the list MUST be a **separate JSON object** representing **ONE unique study instance or analysis subgroup** identified according to the "Handling Multiple Analysis Units" section above.
* The keys within each JSON object MUST exactly match the variable names listed in the template (e.g., "study_id", "author", "Type of cancer", "model-name", "Recall").
